# Network Upgrade Project

## Overview
This project involves a comprehensive plan for upgrading an existing network infrastructure to enhance performance and security. The design and implementation are based on the assignment from McGill University's cybersecurity course.

## Objectives
- Upgrade the network infrastructure.
- Enhance performance and security.
- Implement advanced networking features.

## Existing Network Overview

- **Capacity:** Initially intended for a smaller user base, currently experiencing bottlenecks and decreased efficiency.
- **Hardware:** Obsolete networking devices, such as routers and switches, unable to cope with present data flow and security requirements.
- **Redundancy:** Absence of multiple Internet service providers and backup systems, leading to critical vulnerabilities.
- **Security:** Primitive security setup, inadequate for protection against contemporary cyber threats.
- **Design:** Suboptimal layout with ineffective VLAN distribution, compromising both network performance and safety.
- **Wireless Access:** Restricted range and archaic Wi-Fi standards, falling short of present-day usage expectations.

## Network Design

This section outlines our New Network Design for a modern three-story, 45,000 sq ft office building. It features a meticulously planned network to support various departments with distinct needs, ensuring robust infrastructure and advanced connectivity. Key highlights include optimized floor allocation, enhanced office connectivity, comprehensive client support, and future-proof server solutions. Detailed technical specifications, hardware lists, and floor plans are available in the Network_Design folder.

## Implementation Details
The network was implemented using Cisco IOS commands, as documented in the 'Code' folder. A Packet Tracer simulation was used for demonstration, available in the 'Packet_Tracer_File' folder.

## Challenges and Solutions
(Discuss any challenges faced during the implementation and the solutions employed.)

## Future Improvements
(Outline potential future enhancements to the network.)

## Screenshots
(Include screenshots from the Packet Tracer simulation here.)
